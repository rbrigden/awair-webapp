<i> Disclaimer: </i> This application relies on Microsoft's Project Oxford speech-to-text API, which does not provide the accuracy we would like for final production. The team is currently taking steps to find a more reliable transcription engine before we expand coverage to include more cities. None of the information provided by Awair should be considered reliable and the application in its entirety is currently a proof of concept.
